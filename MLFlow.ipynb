    "In case we are starting the UI by pointing directly to the SQLite file, the new experiment will only show up after logging a run, and even then they may look like they’re under default. This is because the UI isn’t a full tracking server — it’s just a static viewer and the experiment wasn’t created via the server API. In this mode, MLflow happily logs your run, but the UI only shows experiments that were created through the server API. Since we're bypassing the server, the UI doesn’t know about my-experiment and lumps the run under default.\n",

    "On the other hand, setting the tracking UI to localhost (or in this case: 127.0.0.1) makes the new experiment immediately visible in the UI. This is because setting the tracking to localhost makes the notebook talk to the server via REST API, and the server writes into the DB. This is the “production-like” setup, and the UI at http://localhost:5000 shows experiments created through the server.\n",
